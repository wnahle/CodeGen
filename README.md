# ChatGPT/Bard Code Generator CLI ## Why This Exists Tired of breaking your workflow to copy and paste code from ChatGPT or Bard? So was I! Switching between the terminal or editor and a browser got old fast. That’s why I built this: a command-line tool that lets you generate and extract code snippets directly, stripping away the verbose explanations ("bloviation") in the process. Even better? It integrates seamlessly with Vim (or your favorite editor) via plugins, so you can run it without ever leaving your coding zone. ## Key Features - **Command-Line Simplicity:** Generate code directly from the terminal—no copy-paste required. - **Clean Output:** Automatically removes the extra fluff to give you just the code. - **Editor Integration:** Supports Vim plugins for an even smoother workflow. - **Broad Compatibility:** Works with both ChatGPT and Bard.
